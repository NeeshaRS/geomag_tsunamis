# geomag_tsunamis
Codes relevant to studying the electromagnetic fields from tsunamis.

These codes were written in 2012-2015 by Neesha R. Schnepf. If you use these codes for scientific 
research, please cite the below reference(s).

Note: in this repository, "F", "H", and "Z" denote the scalar field, horizontal field, and vertical
field components. When a script starts with "F", "H", or "Z" it means that script is being applied
to that component of the magnetic field data. No special naming convention is given to denote 
scripts that are functions.
