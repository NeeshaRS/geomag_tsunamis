# geomag_tsunamis
Codes relevant to studying the electromagnetic fields from tsunamis.

These codes were written in 2012-2015 by Neesha R. Schnepf. If you use these codes for scientific 
research, please cite the below reference(s).

Notes on conventions: 

> "F", "H", and "Z" denote the scalar field, horizontal field, and vertical field components. 
When a script starts with "F", "H", or "Z" it means that script is being applied to that component 
of the magnetic field data. 
> No special naming convention is given to denote scripts that are functions.
> HPF = high pass filter
> CWA = cross-wavelet analysis
