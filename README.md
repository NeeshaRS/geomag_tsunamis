# geomag_tsunamis
Codes relevant to studying the electromagnetic fields from tsunamis.

These codes were written in 2012-2015 by Neesha R. Schnepf. If you use these codes for scientific 
research, please cite the below reference(s).

Notes on conventions: 

> "F", "H", and "Z" denote the scalar field, horizontal field, and vertical field components. 
When a script starts with "F", "H", or "Z" it means that script is being applied to that component 
of the magnetic field data. 

> No special naming convention is given to denote scripts that are functions.

> CBI = Chichijima geomagnetic observatory (find at http://www.wdc.bgs.ac.uk/catalog/master.html)

> CWA = cross-wavelet analysis

> HPF = high pass filter

> KAK = Kakioka geomagnetic observatory (find at http://www.wdc.bgs.ac.uk/catalog/master.html)

> OBEM = ocean-bottom electromagnetic station

> OBEM data was received from H. Toh and H. Sugioka. These different OBEMs are denoted as NWP, T18, and SOC1-9.
